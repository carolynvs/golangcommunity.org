Go 1.11 contains a much debated and awaited feature: built-in dependency management.
With go modules, you can `go get` a specific version of a package, and rely on that
version in your code without using a vendor directory.

It is an experimental feature that is disabled by default in Go 1.11. We are still
collecting feedback and refining how they work. So now is the best time to learn
how they work, provide feedback and propose changes!
